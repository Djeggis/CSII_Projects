# CSII_Projects
Contains the C++ projects made for my CS2 class   
## HWs   
Contains HW projects used to learn and practice C++ concepts such as pointers, hash tables, and sort methods   
## Project Zero - Basic Theater Reservation   
A basic theater reservation system utilizing arrays and simple operations   
[0.project_zero: Theater Reservation](https://github.com/Djeggis/CSII_Projects/tree/main/0.project_zero%20-%20Theater%20Reservation/Project%20Zero)   
## Project One - Rewards Program System   
Implementation of a rewards program system in which customers are assigned a tier and gain rewards depending on how much they spend. Main concept practiced was the use of pointers.
